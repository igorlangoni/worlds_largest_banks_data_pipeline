# World's Largest Banks

### Overview
 Data Engineering Project for the IBM Data Engineering Specialization
<p>
    For this Data Engineering Project for the IBM DATA ENGINEERING SPECIALIZATION, I have been hired as a data engineer by a research organization. My boss has asked me to create a code that can be used to compile the list of the top 10 largest banks in the world ranked by market capitalization in billion USD. Further, the data needs to be transformed and stored in GBP, EUR and INR as well, in accordance with the exchange rate information that has been made available to me as a CSV file.<br>
    My job is to create an automated system to generate this information so that the same can be executed in every financial quarter to prepare the report. <br>
